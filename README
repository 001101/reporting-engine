This repository hosts alternative reporting engines to the ones included on OpenERP core (RML and Webkit). It is complemented with the ones that host the reports theirself:

https://launchpad.net/account-financial-report
https://launchpad.net/purchase-report
https://launchpad.net/sale-reports
...

The convention is to use a suffix to each module to indicate that it's for using with that report engine (for example, account_invoice_report_birt or sale_order_report_pentaho).

It can contain also another utilities directly involved with reports (like merge/split utils, checkers, signing tools and so on).
